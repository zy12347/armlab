This project presents an overview of a 5-
degree-of-freedom (DOF) autonomous robotic arm. The
problem of autonomous robotic arm control is to develop
a system capable of accurately perceiving its environment,
making informed decisions, and executing tasks reliably
and flexibly without human intervention; innovations in
this area can not only improve safety for employees in
high-risk work environments but also be used to perform
lower value and repetitive tasks. For a 5-DOF robotic arm
to autonomously stack blocks of different sizes, colors,
and positions, it must use computer vision techniques,
kinematics, and path planning to manipulate the desired
objects. The arm is equipped with sensors and algorithms
that allow it to perceive and respond to changes in its
surroundings in real time. There are numerous approaches
to automating a robotic arm, including utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks to continually learn and train
from the data it receives, thereby enabling it to improve
its performance over time. Our armâ€™s design incorporates
inverse kinematics to determine appropriate end effector
waypoints and computer vision techniques to complete
the desired tasks accurately. The report also covers the
testing and validation of the arm, including experiments
that demonstrate its ability to perform a range of tasks,
including grasping, reaching, and orienting objects in a
controlled environment. The results show that the 5-DOF
autonomous arm has a high level of accuracy and efficiency,
making it suitable for a variety of applications in fields such
as manufacturing, service robots, and areas of collaborative
robotics.
